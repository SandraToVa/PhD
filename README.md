# PhD scripts
Matlab scripts (quarkonium and hybrids)
- **RubenFiles**: are not modified from the code that Joan gave me from Ruben
- **SandraFiles**: the files that I have created
    - <ins>Extrapolations</ins>: in this folder I have all the scripts that are used to compute the spectrum and obtain the correct coeficients for the interpolations
    - <ins>PhD</ins>: in this folder I have all related to the computation of the decay with between Q->Q (these transitions are already corrected before the missing operator problem)
    - <ins>Practiques</ins>: this is an obsolete folder where I had the first scripts that I did using RubenFiles as reference
- **Source**: the files where the computation of the schr√∂dinger equations are done. They compute the actual wavefunctions and spectrum for a general case
- The srcipts withou folder are the actual interesting part. For each quarkonium and hybrid state they compute the spectrum and the wavefunctions using the files from _Source_. The other files all use these scripts
